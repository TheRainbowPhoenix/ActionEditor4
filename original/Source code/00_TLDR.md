Of course. Based on the full context of the code you provided, here is a high-level overview of the main data structures and their relationships, followed by a recommendation on where to focus your porting efforts.

### TL;DR: Codebase Overview

This codebase describes a classic 2D platformer/action game engine, likely made with a visual editor. The data is highly structured and relational.

#### Main Data Types (File Level)

1.  **`ワールドマップ` (World_Map):** Represents the entire overworld map (`WorldMap.dat`). It contains the map's dimensions, tile data, and a list of `イベント` (Events) that can be triggered on the map.

2.  **`ステージ` (Stage):** This is the core level file (e.g., `level1.dat`). It's the most important container. It holds:
    *   Level-specific physics like `重力` (gravity).
    *   Game rules like `制限時間` (time limit).
    *   Scrolling behavior.
    *   Lists of all objects placed in the level: `ステージブロック` (Stage_Blocks), `ステージキャラ` (Stage_Characters), `ステージアイテム` (Stage_Items).
    *   A level-specific object library: `ステージパレット` (Stage_Palette).

3.  **`コモンパレット` (Common_Palette):** A global library of reusable game objects (`CommonPalette.cplt4`). This file contains pre-defined `ブロック` (Blocks), `キャラ` (Characters), and `アイテム` (Items) that can be used across any stage, reducing duplication.

4.  **Asset Databases (`*データベース`):** These are simple catalogs that link an ID to an external asset file and its metadata.
    *   `効果音データベース` (Sound_Effect_Database): Maps IDs to `.wav` files.
    *   `キャラの専用bmpデータベース` (Character_Exclusive_Bmp_Database): Maps IDs to special character `.bmp` files.
    *   `ソードタイプデータベース` (Sword_Type_Database): Defines complex sword attacks, linking IDs to graphics (`.bmp`) and attack pattern data.
    *   `エフェクトデータベース` (Effect_Database): Maps IDs to visual effect `.bmp` files and their animation data.
    *   `キャラエフェクトデータベース` (Character_Effect_Database): Defines pre-canned effects for characters (like invincibility flashes, death explosions).

#### How They Are Linked Together

The structure is hierarchical, starting from the world map and drilling down into individual character actions:

1.  The game starts and loads the **`World_Map`**.
2.  The player moves on the map and interacts with an **`イベント` (Event)**.
3.  The `Event` contains the filename of a **`ステージ` (Stage)** to load.
4.  The `Stage` file is loaded. It defines the level layout and contains placed objects. These objects are defined by referencing either the **`ステージパレット` (Stage_Palette)** within the stage file itself, or the global **`コモンパレット` (Common_Palette)**.
5.  The most important object is the **`キャラ` (Character)**. Its behavior is not hardcoded but is defined by a list of **`フロー` (Flows)**.
6.  A **`フロー` (Flow)** is a script. It has `基本条件` (Conditions) that must be met for it to run (e.g., "HP < 50%" or "Player presses Z key").
7.  When a `Flow` runs, it executes a sequence of **`コマンド` (Commands)**.
8.  Each **`コマンド` (Command)** is a single action, like "Move", "Shoot", or "Wait". The specific parameters for that action (e.g., shot speed, wait duration) are stored in a corresponding **`*詳細` (Details)** struct (e.g., `ショット詳細` or `ウェイト詳細`).

**In short:** The `main.cpp` game loop is essentially a big interpreter that processes the `Flows` for each `Character` on every frame, checking their conditions and executing their `Commands`.

### Porting Strategy: Where to Focus

Given this structure, here is a recommended focus for your porting efforts, from most critical to least:

1.  **The Command Execution Logic (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Focus on:** The functions in `main.cpp` like `フロー実行` (Execute_Flow), `ショット実行` (Execute_Shot), `ジャンプ実行` (Execute_Jump), and all the collision detection functions (`*と*の当たり判定`).
    *   **Why:** This is the heart of the engine. It's the code that turns the data into gameplay. All the game's physics, actions, and interactions happen here. If you can correctly interpret and execute a single `Command` (like `ショット詳細`), you have the core of the game running.

2.  **The Character and Flow Structures:**
    *   **Focus on:** `キャラ` (Character) and `フロー` (Flow) structs. The logic that prepares and manages the state of these flows (`フロー実行準備`, `フロー削除`) is crucial.
    *   **Why:** The `Character` is the primary "actor" in the game, and the `Flow` is its brain. Once you have command execution working, you need the system that decides *which* commands to run and when.

3.  **The Stage and Palette Loading:**
    *   **Focus on:** The `ステージ` (Stage), `コモンパレット` (Common_Palette), and `ステージパレット` (Stage_Palette) data structures and their loading functions (`*読込`).
    *   **Why:** Once you can process a single character's logic, you need to be able to load a complete level with all its objects. Getting the file I/O for these large, complex container structures right is the next logical step.

4.  **The Asset Databases and World Map:**
    *   **Focus on:** All the `*データベース` files and the `ワールドマップ` (World_Map) structure.
    *   **Why:** These are comparatively simple. They are mostly just lists of file paths and simple metadata. You can even stub them out initially (e.g., always load the same test level, use placeholder graphics) while you focus on the core gameplay logic in steps 1-3. The world map is the "menu" that leads to the gameplay, so it can be ported last.

By focusing on the `Command` interpreter first, you tackle the most complex and vital part of the engine, ensuring that when you do load the data, it will actually *do* something correctly.
