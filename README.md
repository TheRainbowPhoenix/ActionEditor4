ActionEditor4 is a now dead game engine wrote in 2008 by Anton. The site was located at `http://omoshiro-game.com/soft/ActionEditor4/` and is now for sale.

Patterns available on the "patterns" folder are meant to explore the binary files format used by the engine and can be used with "ImHEX" as "pattern", or adapted to any software to read original format
